# Potential security issues
1. [ ] Private project code leaked to external AI services
   - Host all AI models locally/on a private server.
   - Build the ML LLM service as a docker container and run it alongside the main app.
   - 
2. [ ] User access control
   - Implement user login functionality and allow access to imported repos only to user that imported them
   
3. [ ] Source code security issues
   - Implement SAST tool to scan code in CI
